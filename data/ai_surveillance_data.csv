"""Artificial_intelligence"" ""surveillance""",Surveillance,"As we dive into the world of artificial intelligence, there?s a pertinent issue that?s flying under the radar. Everyone?s buzzing about the big three threats?job loss, bias, and surveillance concerns. We?ve heard the stories about how AI could disrupt jobs across various sectors, impacting everyone from doctors to drivers to marketers. We?ve seen troubling examples, like algorithms predicting higher rates of reoffending for Black men than their white counterparts. And we can?t escape the chatter about the way apps help authorities monitor our activities, with companies tracking every little thing we do.

But there?s another angle we aren?t discussing enough, and it's just as important: the impact of AI on human relationships. 

The traditional narrative about AI?s threats is masking what might be a broader ?depersonalization crisis.? If we really care about the rising tides of loneliness and social disconnection, we need to hone in on how our relationships are molded?or hindered?by our ever-growing reliance on technology.

I spent five years diving into this issue, chatting with over 100 folks including counselors and teachers, as well as the engineers who develop the tech that automates these interactions. What I found was pretty eye-opening: technology is making the human side of these jobs less visible. It's pushing workers to prove they're not robots while companies keep piling on responsibilities, squeezing their time and energy into smaller and smaller pockets. No matter how sophisticated AI gets, real human connections suffer when one half of the conversation is just a machine.

At the core of this conversation is the need for human connection. As Bert, a teacher and private school principal, told me, ?Every kid needs to be seen, really seen.? He emphasizes that kids don?t truly grasp the material until they feel acknowledged by the person guiding their learning.

People thrive on that recognition?it helps clients heal, students learn, workers stay engaged, and customers feel satisfied. I?ve coined this essential work as ?connective labor,? which is both valuable and deeply meaningful for many. Pamela, a teacher in the Bay Area, shared how a middle school teacher took the time to understand her selective mutism stemming from constant family relocations. She wanted to embody that kind of support and understanding for her own students.

But despite its value, connective labor is facing serious threats from automation and AI. Therapy, arguably one of the most human-centric professions, is already seeing the rise of automated bots like Woebot and MARCo. It?s a bit like when Michael Barbaro from The Daily remarked that when ChatGPT3 seemed to understand him, he felt ?really seen.? 

Technologists argue that AI can enhance human performance and accessibility, but that often feels like a punchline to an old joke about overly picky guests at a resort complaining about awful food?and the portions being too small! While it?s true that the human side of work comes with risks?including judgment and misunderstandings?those working conditions also shape how we perceive each other.

?I don?t invite people to open up because I don?t have time,? remarks Jenna, a pediatrician. ?That?s such a disservice to my patients. I?m already on the clock, trying to get them out the door with their meds because I have a full schedule waiting.?

Veronica?s experience showcases some of the downsides of socioemotional AI. Working as an ?online coach? for a therapy app in San Francisco, she was designed to facilitate client interactions with the app, but couldn't offer actual advice. ?I loved feeling like I had an impact,? she said, but then quickly followed with, ?Even though I wasn?t really doing anything. I was just cheering them on.? This captures how AI can diminish the visibility of the humans working diligently behind the scenes, often leading them to minimize their own roles.

Veronica also faced a strange new challenge: convincing clients she was a real person. ?A lot of people asked if I was a robot,? she shared. To combat that, she?d try to engage in small talk, sharing bits of her life whenever it was appropriate. It?s a weird twist?her deep human job required her to prove her humanity, when it shouldn?t have.

In the end, Veronica found the work meaningful but left when the company started to increase client loads to unmanageable levels. ?They thought algorithms could account for every emotional nuance of the job,? she explained. But that isn?t how real connections work, and this kind of thinking only deepens the widening gap in human connections.

As we continue to grapple with a crisis of depersonalization, becoming ?seen? is growing increasingly rare. Many are feeling invisible, feeding into widespread frustrations in the U.S. and beyond, coupled with social issues like rising suicide and overdose rates that affect life expectancy.

Even as many folks maintain close bonds with family and friends, our societal connections?those ?weak ties? found in civic and commercial interactions?are changing. Research has shown that these seemingly trivial interactions, like chatting with a barista, can enhance our well-being significantly.

In response to this crisis, Big Tech proposes what they call personalization?offering tailored education and health services that promise to fill the void left by standardization. But what if we need more than just recognition from machines? What if real human interaction is what truly matters for our society?

Considering this, the conditions for jobs like those of Bert, Jenna, and Veronica are significant. Policies aimed at reducing client loads and work hours could alleviate some of the pressure faced by medical residents, public school teachers, and domestic workers alike?there's even talk of a proposed National Domestic Workers Bill of Rights in Congress.

We also need to rein in the obsession with data analytics, as those data entry tasks often fall on the very people trying to create human connections. It?s essential to acknowledge how new technologies encroach upon the realm of connective labor. We should be informed when we?re interacting with socioemotional AI so we can genuinely seek out those human connections.

Ultimately, it's on all of us to safeguard the human ties that exist in our communities because those bonds are the hidden costs of the tech-driven landscape we are navigating. AI is frequently marketed as a means to free us up for richer tasks, but connective labor is undoubtedly some of the most meaningful work we do. While humans can be messy and imperfect, our attention and care are fundamental sources of belonging and community. If we disregard this reality in the rush to embrace technology, we risk not just individual livelihoods but the very fabric of our social lives.

"""AI"" ""body_camera""",Body Camera,"Police officers are starting to use AI chatbots to write crime reports. Will they hold up in court? | Associated Press

A body camera captured every word and bark uttered as police Sgt. Matt Gilmore and his K-9 dog, Gunner, searched for a group of suspects for nearly an hour.

Normally, the Oklahoma City police sergeant would grab his laptop and spend another 30 to 45 minutes writing up a report about the search. But this time he had artificial intelligence write the first draft.

Pulling from all the sounds and radio chatter picked up by the microphone attached to Gilbert?s body camera, the AI tool churned out a report in eight seconds.

?It was a better report than I could have ever written, and it was 100% accurate. It flowed better,? Gilbert said. It even documented a fact he didn?t remember hearing ? another officer?s mention of the color of the car the suspects ran from.

Oklahoma City?s police department is one of a handful to experiment with AI chatbots to produce the first drafts of incident reports. Police officers who?ve tried it are enthused about the time-saving technology, while some prosecutors, police watchdogs and legal scholars have concerns about how it could alter a fundamental document in the criminal justice system that plays a role in who gets prosecuted or imprisoned.

Built with the same technology as ChatGPT and sold by Axon, best known for developing the Taser and as the dominant U.S. supplier of body cameras, it could become what Gilbert describes as another ?game changer? for police work.

?They become police officers because they want to do police work, and spending half their day doing data entry is just a tedious part of the job that they hate,? said Axon?s founder and CEO Rick Smith, describing the new AI product ? called Draft One ? as having the ?most positive reaction? of any product the company has introduced.

?Now, there?s certainly concerns,? Smith added. In particular, he said district attorneys prosecuting a criminal case want to be sure that police officers ? not solely an AI chatbot ? are responsible for authoring their reports because they may have to testify in court about what they witnessed.

?They never want to get an officer on the stand who says, well, ?The AI wrote that, I didn?t,?? Smith said.

AI technology is not new to police agencies, which have adopted algorithmic tools to read license plates, recognize suspects? faces, detect gunshot sounds and predict where crimes might occur. Many of those applications have come with privacy and civil rights concerns and attempts by legislators to set safeguards. But the introduction of AI-generated police reports is so new that there are few, if any, guardrails guiding their use.

Updated on: August 27, 2024 9:53 AM
SOURCE: cybernews.com/privacy/texas-?

The Texas Department of Public Safety has signed a five-year contract and will spend $5.3 million on an AI-powered surveillance tool. The tool is capable of conducting online undercover investigations and tracking devices, the Texas Observer reports.

Tangles software is developed by Cobwebs Technologies, an Israeli security company now part of PenLink. 

***The intelligence solution can monitor online activity and collect and analyze data from ?endless digital channels ? from the open, deep, and dark web to mobile and social.?***

Meta previously removed 200 company-operated accounts for violating its terms, due to reconnaissance across the internet, including popular social media sites.

The accounts used by Cobwebs customers ?engaged in social engineering to join closed communities and forums and trick people into revealing personal information,? Meta?s report said in its surveillance-for-hire industry report in 2021.

According to the Texas Observer report, the surveillance tools include an add-on feature called WebLoc, which can track mobile devices? movement in a selected area without a warrant. This has raised privacy concerns before, with advocates arguing that such tech circumvents legal protection against warrantless searches and violates privacy rights.

Surveillance tools combine data collected from various sources, including solid data brokers. In-app advertisers can pull a lot of personal data from smartphones.

A PenLink spokesperson told the Observer their ?open-source intelligence (OSINT) solutions are used to protect our communities from crime, threats, and cyberattacks by providing seamless access to data that is publicly available.?

Cobwebs has previously sold contracts to the IRS and LAPD, according to Vice. 

LAPD previously stated that the controversial mass surveillance software greatly aids investigations and acts as a force multiplier in processing obtained data.

Preferred information about actual medical inoculation is now being protected by ? more ?inoculation.?

This latter form is proliferated via an ?AI? (machine learning) tool against ?misinformation? about vaccines.

It is the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) ? or rather, US taxpayers ? that is funding this effort.

The University of Pennsylvania is the recipient of the $4 million covering the period from April 2022 until March 2027, used to conduct a randomized trial called ?Inoculate for HPV Vaccine? and produce the said tool.

This information came to light thanks to the Children?s Health Defense (CHD) freedom of information request to gain access to grant documents.

Associate professor of nursing at the University of Pennsylvania Melanie L. Kornides heads the team behind the study. Kornides ?specializes? in researching vaccine uptake and anti-misinformation strategies, while others taking part in this project are software developers, machine learning and communication experts, and social media analysts, reports say.

Their task is to scour YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram for user data, and create an ?inoculation tool? to pinpoint ?HPV vaccine misinformation? as well as content expressing vaccine skepticism ? ?whether or not the information in the post is true or false.?

What these researchers themselves have said about how the tool can be used is of particular interest ? HPV vaccines aside, it can allegedly be repurposed to identify ?misinformation? about a range of issues, such as Covid and cancer treatment. And this can be done ?swiftly and efficiently.?

Meanwhile, the ?AI tool? will be developed through trials involving one control and two test groups that will be ?inoculated? against criticism of the HPV vaccine, or with messages that criticize those opposed to vaccines.

To make sure the subjects are adopting the desired way of thinking, the experiment will involve exposure to ?booster messages? at several intervals.

Artificial intelligence #artificialintelligenceis starting to play an important role in video surveillance and providing better security in preventing crimes and evil in our modern society. Some AI-based security systems use machine  learning. This allows the camera to 'learn' the normal behavior of the area and send alerts based on unusual activity. These AI #ai  systems also create triggers; For example, when a  store wants to be informed about thieves, if someone is seen hiding behind or outside the area shown by the video camera, the system notifies the security guards  and can the situation  be resolved? real time.

"""Machine_learning"" ""surveillance""",Surveillance,"Yes, machine learning is increasingly being used in school surveillance cameras to enhance security and monitor student behavior. The technology can analyze video footage in real time to detect various activities, such as unauthorized entry, violence, or unusual behavior patterns. Some schools are even using AI models to recognize faces, track movements, and analyze body language for potential threats.

**Advanced Features in School Camera Models:**

1. **Facial Recognition:** Some systems can identify individuals and check against a list of authorized persons, alerting authorities if an unknown or flagged person is detected.

2. **Behavioral Analysis:** AI models can analyze body language and movement patterns to detect potentially suspicious behavior, like loitering or aggression.

3. **Object Detection:** Cameras can recognize specific objects, such as weapons, and trigger alerts if they are detected.

4. **Anomaly Detection:** Machine learning models can learn normal patterns of behavior within the school environment and flag any deviations as potential threats.

5. **License Plate Recognition:** For school parking lots, cameras may be equipped with technology to recognize and log vehicle license plates, helping to identify unauthorized vehicles.

**Model Sophistication:**

The sophistication of these models can vary significantly based on the technology used and the budget of the school district. High-end systems may use advanced deep learning algorithms that are capable of real-time analysis with high accuracy. These systems are often trained on large datasets to improve their ability to detect a wide range of behaviors and scenarios.

Less sophisticated systems might rely on simpler algorithms that focus on more basic tasks, like motion detection or identifying specific objects. However, even these systems are becoming increasingly advanced as machine learning technology becomes more accessible and affordable.

Overall, the use of machine learning in school cameras is part of a broader trend of integrating AI into security and monitoring systems, with the goal of improving safety and response times in potentially dangerous situations.",0.9227,13-Aug-24

"""Machine_learning"" ""surveillance""",Surveillance,"Argentina's Ministry of Security has launched an Artificial Intelligence Unit aimed at predicting future crimes through data analysis and surveillance. This unit will employ machine learning algorithms to analyze historical crime data and utilize tools like drone monitoring and social media tracking to prevent and respond to threats.

Public safety is among the top three challenges for the upcoming presidential election, according to polls. We can develop focused solutions to address this issue effectively.
But America's public sector is lagging in adopting innovative AI approaches to solve the everyday problems.

We deployed ALPR Cameras in the city of Saratoga. AI enhances ALPR systems by improving accuracy and efficiency. AI algorithms can filter out irrelevant data, recognize patterns, and provide actionable insights. This includes identifying vehicles associated with criminal activity and generating alerts for law enforcement.

We have caught criminals casing our neighborhood thanks to these cameras. With a variety of neighborhood efforts, Saratoga dropped burglaries by 50% - the largest year to year drop compared to any other Santa Clara County City.

AI has its challenges: Human rights groups are concerned about potential infringements on freedom of expression, fearing that public self-censorship may result from government monitoring. A prior court ruling deemed the use of facial recognition technology in Buenos Aires unconstitutional due to inadequate personal rights protections.

Every good innovation can be misused. With the right policies, we can ensure that groundbreaking technology is used responsibly. I'll explore this further in my next article.

""A facial recognition start-up, accused of invasion of privacy in a class-action lawsuit, has agreed to a settlement, with a twist: Rather than cash payments, it would give a 23 percent stake in the company to Americans whose faces are in its database.""

""Clearview AI, which is based in New York, scraped billions of photos from the web and social media sites like Facebook, LinkedIn and Instagram to build a facial recognition app used by thousands of police departments, the Department of Homeland Security and the F.B.I. After The New York Times revealed the company?s existence in 2020, lawsuits were filed across the country. They were consolidated in federal court in Chicago as a class action.""

""Anyone in the United States who has a photo of himself or herself posted publicly online ? so almost everybody ? could be considered a member of the class. The settlement would collectively give the members a 23 percent stake in Clearview AI, which is valued at $225 million, according to court filings. (Twenty-three percent of the company?s current value would be about $52 million.)""

""Jay Edelson, a class-action lawyer, is a proponent of 'future stakes settlement' in cases involving start-ups with limited funds. Mr. Edelson has also sued Clearview AI, alongside the American Civil Liberties Union, in a state lawsuit in Illinois that was settled in 2022, with Clearview agreeing not to sell its database of 40 billion photos to businesses or individuals.""

Paper 

A comprehensive study toward high level approaches for weapon screening using classical machine learning

Surveillance systems often fall short in promptly addressing activities, such as armed robbery in public areas. Consequently, there is a pressing need for technology that can autonomously identify activities from Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) footage without human intervention. While various high performance computing algorithms have been developed, they are often limited to specific conditions. This paper aims to bridge the gaps in existing technologies for weapon detection. The automatic identification of guns/weapons could significantly aid in the investigation of crime scenes. A challenging yet crucial area of focus is the identification of the specific type of firearm used in an attack, known as intra-class detection. This study meticulously evaluates and categorizes the strengths and limitations of various existing algorithms, utilizing classical machine learning and deep learning approaches for the detection of different types of weapons. We comprehensively compare and analyze the performance of several recent state-of-the-art methods on diverse datasets, along with outlining their future potential. Our findings reveal that deep learning techniques outperform traditional machine learning methods in terms of both speed and accuracy.

US Army 

The U.S. Army is currently in the process of developing new rifles for the first time in 50 years. The main focus is to ensure that these rifles are powerful enough to effectively handle modern body armor.ÿ

The new rifles being developed by the U.S. Army would be using a new type of caliber ammunition, which is expected to have better armor-penetrating capabilities as compared to the smaller rounds used in the current rifles. The Army's focus on this development stems from the increasing availability of affordable bulletproof gear worn by Chinese and Russian military personnel.

This is absolutely terrifying. It doesn't matter if the CCP is building it with ""good"" intentions. They are developing the most technologically advanced dictatorship in history. I don't think this is being talked about enough.

""This Article addresses what happens when policing patterns are reduced to AI-generated police reports with police officers filling in the gaps with the help of their police-body camera audio.ÿThis is the question soon to be facing courts with Axon?s launch of ?Draft One? ? an Open AI GPT-4 Turbo modelÿpolice report writing system. In simplified form, the audio from a police officer's body camera generates a draft police report, with various filters, inserts, and prompts built via generative AI large language models.ÿPolice reports become a fill-in-the-blanks ?Mad-Libs? of suspicion, investigation, and fact-development ready for court. The promise for police departments is increased efficiency, consistency, and a significant time-savings around admittedly tedious paperwork.ÿThe danger for the criminal legal system is the digital poisoning of fact-based development in criminal trials by algorithmically altering the narrative."" (page 4)

-

""The questions that arise involve three sets of concerns. The first concern involves training data and how the AI models were trained to fill inÿthe reports. The second concern involves the transfer of data from the streetsÿto the narrative report through automated translation/transcriptionÿtechnology. The third area of concern involves the final report and howÿgenerative AI transforms the structure and substance of the report."" (page 23)

-

""Next generation AI might go even further, obviating the need for theÿpolice officer to narrate the scene via audio. Video analytics technology hasÿalready mastered the task of identifying simple objects and actions.ÿVideoÿanalytics currently in use in more sophisticated police departments can searchÿfor a particular object (hat, backpack, gun) throughout thousands ofÿcameras.ÿIn short order, those same images and the object recognitionÿtechnology will generate a narrative of what is happening on the video.ÿThe objects will be recognized, the actions cataloged, and a narrative description provided.ÿIn the policing context, an AI would review the videoÿand determine the person, crime, and severity to include in the police report.ÿ(...)"" (page 53)

? The topic has been all over the media recently (links below), so it's a great idea to read this in-depth overview of potential ethical & legal implications and to reflect on what this AI-powered tool might mean in the bigger picture of the criminal system.

Argentina's Ministry of Security has announced the creation of an Artificial Intelligence Unit to ""predict future crimes"" through data analysis and surveillance. 

The unit will use machine learning algorithms to examine historical crime data and deploy tools like drone monitoring and social media tracking to prevent and respond to threats.

Human rights groups have expressed concerns that these measures could infringe on freedom of expression, as the public may self-censor for fear of government monitoring. 

A previous court ruling found the government's use of facial recognition technology in the city of Buenos Aires to be unconstitutional, citing lack of protections for personal rights.

Banned Applications
New rules ban AI applications that threaten citizens' rights, such as:
- Biometric categorization based on sensitive traits.
- Scraping facial images from the internet or CCTV to create facial recognition databases.
- Emotion recognition in workplaces and schools.
- Social scoring.
- Predictive policing based on profiling.
- AI that manipulates behavior or exploits vulnerabilities.

Law Enforcement Exceptions
Biometric identification by law enforcement is generally banned, with exceptions for: Time-limited and geographically specific real-time uses with judicial or administrative approval, like finding a missing person or preventing a terrorist attack.

Obligations for High-Risk Systems
High-risk AI systems must:
- Assess and reduce risks.
- Keep usage logs.
- Be transparent and accurate.
- Ensure human oversight.
- Allow citizens to file complaints and get explanations about decisions affecting their rights.

Examples of high-risk AI include those used in infrastructure, education, employment, essential services (like healthcare and banking), law enforcement, migration, border management, and democratic processes.

Transparency Requirements
General-purpose AI (GPAI) systems must:
- Comply with EU copyright laws.
- Publish summaries of training content.
- Powerful GPAI models need additional measures to assess and mitigate risks and report incidents.
- Deepfakes (altered or fake images, audio, or video) must be clearly labeled.
